# This script allows to start a bash interpreter inside a project environment.
# This is called from the extension SwanTerminal and it requires like a parameter the project name to
# build the path to the project with $HOME/SWAN_projects/$PROJECT to load the project environment.
# When the bash session is started we modify the prompt indicating in which project the terminal is located.
# Aditionally bash run completed isolated from other possible environments then we pass like parameters to the isolated environment some
# required basic environment variables such as:
#
# * HOME with path to the user home
# * PATH with default paths for the system
# * OAUTH2_TOKEN required by EOS storage
#
# swan_env will load the other variables from the stack, inside the isolated enviroment.
