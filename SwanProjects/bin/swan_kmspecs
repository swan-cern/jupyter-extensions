"""
This script allows to find the kernels for python2/3 and kernel spec paths for our kernel spec manager.

The script run a subprocess inside the project environment trying to find the package ipykernel
and run jupyter_path('kernels') to get the list of available paths for the differents kernels inside the environment as well.

This is execute in the Create/Edit project handlers and the stdout is captured, getting the json information printed in the function generate_ksminfo()
